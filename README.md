# RoA - Quality of Life
This script includes some QoL stuff for RoA.

Use with [this userstyle](https://userstyles.org/styles/132940/roa-qol) recommened, but not mandatory.

[edvordo/RoA-WSHookUp](https://github.com/edvordo/RoA-WSHookUp) is required for this script to function properly.

Also, an install into a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey is kinda recommended, since this uses some of its functionality.
